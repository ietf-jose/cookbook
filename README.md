# JOSE Cookbook #

This repository contains all of the examples from [Examples of Protecting Content using JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-cookbook) -- affectionately known as the "JOSE Cookbook" -- in a machine-readable format.

The repository has three directories:

* 'jwk' containing the JSON Web Key (JWK) examples
* 'jws' containing the JSON Web Signature (JWS) examples
* 'jwe' containing the JSON Web Encryption (JWE) examples
* 'RFC7797' contains examples with b64=false

Also included is "6.nesting_signatures_and_encryption.json" which contains the example nesting a JWS into a JWE.
